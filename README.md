[iCal Helper](https://ical.vladcuciureanu.com/) lets you import iCal files into your calendar on iOS. This repository contains the entire source code behind it. Why is this needed, you ask? Because Apple restricts iCal imports on iOS to a few scenarios.

You can't:

- Save iCal files to iCloud and open it within Files app.
- Open iCal files via share button.
- Import iCal files via the native Calendar app.

You can only import .ics files if you receive them via Apple's native Mail app.

But you can also open .ics files _via Safari_.
This tool loads an .ics file and opens it in-browser. All client-side.

## Feedback

This is a very simple tool made with a simple use case in mind. It was made in two minutes using technologies I was most comfortable with. That said, I am open to feedback and contributions of any kind :)
