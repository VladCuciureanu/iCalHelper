# üóìÔ∏è iCal Helper

iCal Helper lets you import iCal files into your calendar on iOS.

## Motivation

Why is this needed, you ask? Because Apple restricts iCal imports on iOS to a few scenarios.

For example, you can't:

- Import iCal files via the native Calendar app.
- Open iCal files via share button.
- Bypass it by saving iCal files and opening them within Files app.

You can only import .ics files if you receive them via Apple's native Mail app.

But you can also open .ics files _via Safari_.
This tool loads an .ics file and opens it in-browser.  
Everything runs client-side, keeping your .ical files safe and private.

## Feedback

This is a very simple tool made with a simple use case in mind. It was made in two minutes using technologies I was most comfortable with. That said, I am open to feedback and contributions of any kind :)
